# Contributing to HlexNC Projects

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to my projects, which are hosted on the HlexNC GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report**
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Contributing to Code

Pull Requests are the way changes are made to the code, documentation, dependencies, and tools contained in the HlexNC repositories.

**General Rules for Contributing:**
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull requests whenever possible.
- Follow the style guides for Python, JavaScript, or other languages used in the project.
- Include thoughtful comments in your code. Explain why you're making a change.
- Run the tests to make sure your change doesn't break any existing functionality.
- Create a pull request that directly relates to an existing issue.

**Pull Request Process:**
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
